.SH Info:
This is a site intended to be used as reference material for myself and 
whomever else decides they like my notes. These will be accompanied by
a series of git repos to distribute the code. I will link to them once 
the examples have been finished and fact-checked. The main portion of 
this repository is going to be the man pages.
